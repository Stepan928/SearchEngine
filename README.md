## ü§ñ Introduction
This project represents the final work of the "Information Retrieval and Text Analysis" workshop led by Tom Auger at TUMO Center for Creative Technologies.

**Logo Symbolism:**
The project's logo represents that AI (Artificial Intelligence) is for everyone, no matter their age, race, or gender. The figures in the logo show people from different backgrounds walking together towards a future where AI makes lives better.

## üßê Overview
The AI Search Engine is a Python Django-powered search website crafted to provide a smooth user experience for retrieving information related to Artificial Intelligence. Imagine it as your friendly search assistant, but specifically for AI - it's like a supercharged Google Search designed to make finding AI information easy and efficient.

### Key Features
- **Efficient Search:** Utilizes a sophisticated algorithm to enhance search accuracy and deliver relevant results.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with a minimalistic approach for an optimal user experience.
- **Query Enhancements:** Implements spellchecking, case insensitivity, and query simplification to improve search precision.
- **Advanced Query Options:** Supports various query types, including AND, OR, NOT, phrase searches, and proximity searches.

### Query Processing
- **Spellcheck:** Utilizes SymSpell library for accurate spellchecking.
- **Query Simplification:** Preprocessing functions remove unnecessary parts and apply stemming for improved search accuracy.
- **Query Completion:** Implements an algorithm for efficient search suggestions based on unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.
- **Query Execution:** Handles various search query types for a versatile search experience.

## üîé Query Examples
### Simple Search:
	AI applications in healthcare
### Advanced Search:
	"machine learning" AND ("applications" OR "use cases")
